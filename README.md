# Rasperry-PI-Project

This is for a Raspberry PI Hardware projects class we have no intention to use it for comercial purposes, I worked with a partner to create a simple touch screen friendly alarm clock with a push to send email integration. Alarm clock functions as one would imagine, with the additional feature of sending an email with a simple pre-prepared message to anyone of your choosing. This in case one snoozes one too many times an realizes they will be late to their comitment and needs to send an email to let the person they are supposed to meet that they will be late.

*Note: You will also need the sendmail code, and edit it with the users email and password to allow for main program to send the email

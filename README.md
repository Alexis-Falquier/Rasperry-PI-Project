# Rasperry-PI-Project
# Just beggening to brainstorm the project.
# This is for a Raspberry PI Hardware projects class, I am working with a partner to create some kind of application to implement using the raspberry pi. 
# Ideas so far include a motion detector application which takes pictures when motion is detected and send said pictures to your email
# another idea being having a range finder, connected to an lcd or a web display, such that it can be attached to any car
